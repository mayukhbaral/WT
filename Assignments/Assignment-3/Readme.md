 # Objective: To create button and borders using HTML and CSS
 
 
 # Theory:
    -<button>: The Button element:-
        The <button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.

    -CSS Border Style:-
        The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display.

        The following values are allowed:

        1)dotted - Defines a dotted border
        2)dashed - Defines a dashed border
        3)solid - Defines a solid border
        4)double - Defines a double border
        5)groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
        6)ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
        7)inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
        8)outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
        9)none - Defines no border
        10)hidden - Defines a hidden border
        
        The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).
